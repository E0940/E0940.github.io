<h1>Unit 5: Wave</h1>
<h2>Mechanical Waves</h2>
<p>Mechanical waves require a medium to propagate. They can be classified into transverse waves and longitudinal waves.</p>
<h3>Transverse Waves</h3>
<p>In transverse waves, particles move perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation.</p>
<h3>Longitudinal Waves</h3>
<p>In longitudinal waves, particles move parallel to the direction of wave propagation (vibrates in the same direction as the wave's motion).</p>
<h2>Standing Waves</h2>
<p>Standing waves are formed by the interference of two waves traveling in opposite directions. It stays in a constant position, and are the result of an interference between two waves travelling in different directions.</p>

<h2>Interference</h2>
<p>When two waves of the same type meet, they combine to create a larger or smaller wave.</p>
<h3>Constructive Interference</h3>
<p>Constructive interference occurs when two waves meet and are in phase, leading to a stronger resultant wave.</p>
<p>Antinode: Location of complete constructive interference. The wave will have the greatest displacement at an antinode.</p>
<h3>Destructive Interference</h3>
<p>Destructive interference occurs when two waves meet with opposite phase, leading to a weaker resultant wave or complete cancellation.</p>
<p>Node: Location of complete destructive interference between the incident (initial) wave and the refelcted wave. The wave does not move at a node.</p>
