<h1>Unit 6: Modern Physics</h1>
<h3>Quantum Theory</h3>
<p>Quantum mechanics deals with the behavior of particles on atomic and subatomic scales. It incorporates the principles of wave-particle duality, quantization of energy, and the probabilistic nature of physical phenomena.<br>
The formula for calculating the energy of a quantum is:<br>
Energy of a Photon = Plank's constant x Frequency = Plank's constant x Speed of Light in a Vacuum / Wavelength
</p>

<h3>Photon-Particle Collisions</h3>
<p>A fundamental means by which matter is generated in the universe, and it arises from Einstein's well-known equation Energy = mass Speed of Light in a Vacuum<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p2>All microscopic particles, whether massless, like photons, or having mass, like electrons, have wave properties.</p2>

<h2>Early Modles of atom</h2>
<h3>Thomson's model</h3>
<p>Thomson's experiments with cathode ray tubes showed that all atoms contain tiny negatively charged subatomic particles or electrons. Thomson proposed the plum pudding model of the atom, which had negatively-charged electrons embedded within a positively-charged "soup."</p>

<h3>Rutherford's Model</h3>
<p>The model described the atom as a tiny, dense, positively charged core called a nucleus, in which nearly all the mass is concentrated, around which the light, negative constituents, called electrons, circulate at some distance, much like planets revolving around the Sun.</p>

<h3>The Bohr Model of the Hydrogen Atom</h3>
<p>The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom (Z = 1) or a hydrogen-like ion (Z > 1), where the negatively charged electron confined to an atomic shell encircles a small, positively charged atomic nucleus and where an electron jumps between orbits, is accompanied by an emitted or absorbed amount of electromagnetic energy (hν). When the electron is in any particular orbit, it is said to be in a stationary state. Each stationary state represents a specific amount of energy and is called an energy level. 
</p>

<h3>The Cloud Model</h3>
<p>The electron cloud model was developed in 1924 by Erwin Schrödinger and Werner Heisenberg. The model is a way to help visualize the most probable position of electrons in an atom. The electron cloud model is currently the accepted model of an atom.</p>

<h3>Atomic Spectra</h3>
<p>The emission spectrum of a chemical element or chemical compound is the spectrum of frequencies of electromagnetic radiation emitted due to electrons making a transition from a high energy state to a lower energy state. An atom can absorb only photons having energies equal to specific differences in its energy levels. The frequencies and wavelengths of these absorbed photons are exactly the same as those of the photons emitted when electrons lose energy and fall between the same energy levels.</p>

<p>Energy levels in an atom, introduced by Bohr, provided an explanation for atomic spectra. When an electron in an atom in an excited state falls to a lower energy level, the energy of the emitted photon is equal to the difference between the energies of the initial and final state. <br>Energy of the photon = The initial Energy of an electron - The final Energy of an electron</p>
