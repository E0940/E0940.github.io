<h1>Unit 1: Measurement and Mathematical Skills</h1>
<h2>Significant Figures (Significant Digits)</h2>
<p>Significant figures are crucial in physics as they indicate the precision or accuracy of a measurement. The number of significant figures in a value represents the reliability of the measurement's digit. In physics, it is essential to account for significant figures to ensure the correctness of calculations and maintain the desired level of accuracy in results.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Zeros that appear before a non-zero digit are not significant. Ex: 0.002 m = 1 significant figure & 0.13 kg = 2 significant figures</li>
    <li>Zeros that appear between non-zero digits are significant. Ex: 0.705 g = 3 significant figures & 2009 mm = 4 significant figures</li> 
    <li>Zeros that appear after a non-zero digit are significant only if followed by a decimal point. Ex: 40 s = 1 significant figure & 10. m = 2 significant figures. <br>OR they appear to the right of the decimal point. Ex: 37.0 kg = 3 significant figures & 4.100 m = 4 significant figures.</li>
</ul>

<p>When adding or subtracting with significant figures, the result should retain the same number of decimal places as the measurement with the least number of decimal places. If the result of the addition or subtraction operation extends beyond the decimal places of the least precise measurement, round the final result to the least number of decimal places used in the calculation. <br>Ex: 3.25 m + 1.2 m = 4.45 m (rounded to 4.5 m since the least number of decimal places is 1)</p>

<p>When performing multiplication or division with significant figures, the result should have the same number of significant figures as the measurement with the least number of significant figures. For multiplication or division, count the number of significant figures in each value. The result should have the same number of significant figures as the value with the fewest significant figures. <br>Ex: 5.2 m * 3.1 m = 16.1 m<sup>2</sup> (rounded to 16 m<sup>2</sup> since the least number of significant figures is 2)</p>

<h2>Scientific Notation</h2>
<p>Scientific notation is a way to express numbers as a coefficient multiplied by 10 raised to a power. This notation is commonly used in mathematics and science to represent very large or very small numbers in a concise form. In scientific notation, a number is written as A x 10<sup>n</sup>, where A is the coefficient and n is the exponent of 10. This allows for easier manipulation of numbers and simplifies calculations involving extremely large or small values.</p>
<p>Examples of numbers in scientific notation include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1.25 x 10<sup>6</sup> m/s</li>
    <li>6.02 x 10<sup>23</sup> kg</li>
    <li>2.99 x 10<sup>-9</sup> N</li>
</ul>

<h2>Percent Error</h2>
<p>Percent error is a measure of the accuracy of a measurement compared to the accepted or true value. It is calculated as follows:</p>
<p>Percent Error = |(Experimental Value - Accepted Value) / Accepted Value| * 100%</p>
<p>Ex: If the accepted value of gravitational acceleration is 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup> and an experiment measures it to be 9.60 m/s<sup>2</sup>, the percent error would be calculated as: |(9.60 - 9.81) / 9.81| * 100% = 2.14%</p>

<h2>Scalar Quantities</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Distance</li>
    <li>Speed</li>
    <li>Time</li>
    <li>Mass</li>
    <li>Temperature</li>
</ul>


<h2>Vector Quantities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Displacement</li>
    <li>Velocity</li>
    <li>Acceleration</li>
    <li>Force</li>
    <li>Momentum</li>
  </ul>
