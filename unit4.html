<h1>Unit 4: Electricity and Magnetism</h1>
<p> </p>
<h2>Electrostatics</h2>
<h3>Microstructure of Matter</h3>
<p>Matter is made up of atoms, and atoms can be broken down into protons (postitve charge), electrons (negatively charge), and neutrons (no charge). Each atom has a core called nucleus that contains positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons. It's surrounded by a "cloud" of smaller negatively charged electrons. These electrons orbit the nucleus in energy levels. Electrons must asorb energy in order to move to a higher level. When the electron falls to a lower energy level, it releases energy. The elementary charge, e, is equal in magnatude to the charge on a electron (-e) or the charge on a proton (+e). Neutral atoms will have a equal number of protons and electrons and have a net charge of 0.</p>

<h3>Charged Objects</h3>
<p>An atom will become an ion when they gain or lose electrons. If a atom loses one or more electron it has a net postitve charge, and will be a positive ion. If a atom gains one or more electron it has a net negative charge, and will be a negative ion. Like charges will repel each other while opposite charges attract each other. The charge on an object is represented as the symbol q.</p>

<h3>Transfer of Charge</h3>
<p>When a system has only neutral objects it has a total net charge of 0. When objects in the system are rubbed together, electrons can be transfered between the objects.</p>

<h3>Law of Conservation of Charge</h3>
<p>Charge is always conserved. The total amount of charge and the amount of charge among the objects is the same before and after the process starts and ends</p>

<h3>Quantity of Charge</h3>
<p>The electric charge, q, is a scalar quantity. Charge is a fundamental measurement with a unit of Coulomb [C]. The magnitude of charge on a single proton or electron is called elementary charge (e), which is 1.6x10<sup>-19</sup> coulomb. To make up one single coulomb of charge it would take 6.25x10<sup>18</sup> elementary charges. The net charge of a charged object is always a multiple of e, which means the charge is quantized.</p>

<h3>Coulomb's Law</h3> 
<p>Fe = kq1q2 / r<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Fe = Electrostatic force (N), q1 and q2 = charges in coulombs (C), k Electrostatic force (8.99x10<sup>9</sup> N*m<sup>2</sup>/C<sup>2</sup>), r = distance of separation (m)</p>
