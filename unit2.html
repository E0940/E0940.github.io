<h1>Unit 2: Mechanics</h1>
<h2>Kinematics</h2>
<p>Kinematics is the branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of points, bodies (objects), and systems of bodies without considering the forces that cause the motion.
</p>

<h3>Distance and Displacement</h3>
<p>Distance is a scalar quantity that refers to "how much ground an object has covered" during its motion. 
    Displacement is a vector quantity that refers to "how far out of place an object is" and
    it is the object's overall change in position.
</p>

  <h3>Speed and Velocity</h3>
  <p>Speed is a scalar quantity that refers to "how fast an object is moving." It describes how quickly an object covers distance.</p>
<p>Velocity, on the other hand, is a vector quantity that refers to "the rate at which an object changes its position." It includes both speed and direction.
  </p>
  <p>Formula: style="margin-left: 20px;">Velocity = Displacement / Time</p>

  <h3>Acceleration</h3>
  <p>Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity of an object with respect to time. It is a vector quantity that is defined as the derivative of velocity with respect to time.</p>
  <p>Formula: Acceleration = Change in Velocity / Time</p>

  
  <h3>Final Velocity and Distance Traveled During Constant Acceleration</h3>
  <p>In the case of constant acceleration, the final velocity of an object can be calculated using the formula:</p>
  <p>Final Velocity = Initial Velocity + (Acceleration * Time)</p>
  <p>The distance traveled by the object during this acceleration can be calculated using the formula:</p>
  <p>Distance Traveled = (Initial Velocity * Time) + (0.5 * Acceleration * Time<sup>2</sup>)</p>

  
<h3>Freely Falling Objects</h3>
<p>Freely falling objects are those that are falling under the sole influence of gravity with no other forces acting on them. In this case, the acceleration due to gravity (g) can be considered as approximately 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>For freely falling objects near the surface of the Earth, the acceleration due to gravity can be assumed constant.</p>

<br>

<h2>Statics</h2>
  <h3>Concurrent Forces</h3>
  <p>Concurrent forces are forces that pass through a common point. When two or more forces are applied to an object and their lines of action intersect at a single point, they are called concurrent forces.</p>
  <p>The resultant force of concurrent forces can be calculated by adding the individual forces using the triangle method or the parallelogram method.</p>
  <h3>Triangle Method for Adding Concurrent Forces</h3>
  <p>
    The triangle method is a graphical method used to find the resultant force of concurrent forces. 
    <br>
    To add concurrent forces using the triangle method:
    <br>
    1. Draw a vector representing each force to scale, originating from a common point.
    <br>
    2. Complete the triangle by drawing the third side from the head of the first vector to the tail of the last vector.
    <br>
    3. The resultant force is the vector that closes the triangle, drawn from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Parallelogram Method for Adding Concurrent Forces</h3>
  <p>
    The parallelogram method is a graphical method used to find the resultant force of concurrent forces. 
    <br>
    To add concurrent forces using the parallelogram method:
    <br>
    1. Draw a vector representing each force to scale, originating from a common point.
    <br>
    2. Complete the parallelogram by drawing a parallel line to each vector from the head of the other vector.
    <br>
    3. The resultant force is the diagonal of the parallelogram, starting from the common point.
  </p>

  <h3>Resolution of Forces</h3>
  <p>
    The resolution of forces involves breaking a single force into components that act in specific directions.
    <br>
    For a force F acting at an angle θ to the horizontal, the horizontal component (Fx) and vertical component (Fy) can be calculated as:
    <br>
    Fx = F * cos(θ)
    <br>
    Fy = F * sin(θ)
  </p>

  
  <h3>Equilibrium</h3>
  <p>
    Equilibrium in physics refers to a state where the net force and net torque acting on an object are both zero. 
    <br>
    When an object is in equilibrium:
    <br>
    - For translational equilibrium, the vector sum of all forces acting on the object is zero.
    - For rotational equilibrium, the sum of all torques acting on the object is zero.
    <br>
    In simple terms, an object in equilibrium is either at rest or moving at a constant velocity with no net force or net torque acting on it.
  </p>

  
<h2>Dynamics</h2>
<p>
    Dynamics in physics is the branch of mechanics that deals with the study of the motion of objects and the causes of that motion. It focuses on understanding the relationship between the motion of objects and the forces acting on them. Dynamics helps in analyzing how objects move and interact under the influence of various forces. </p>

    
<h2>Newton's Three Laws of Motion</h2>
<h3>First Law: Law of Inertia</h3>
<p>
    An object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will remain in motion at a constant velocity unless acted upon by a net external force.
</p>

<h3>Second Law: Law of Acceleration</h3>
<p>
    The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. It can be expressed as F = ma.
</p>

<h3>Third Law: Law of Action-Reaction</h3>
<p>
    For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object exerts a force of equal magnitude in the opposite direction on the first object.
</p>

  <h2>Two-Dimensional Motion and Trajectories</h2>
  <p>
    Two-dimensional motion involves movement in both the horizontal and vertical directions. When an object moves in two dimensions, its trajectory can be described as a path in space that shows the object's position at different points in time. The motion of objects in two dimensions can be analyzed using kinematic equations and vector mathematics. Understanding trajectories in two dimensions is important for predicting the path of objects in complex motion scenarios.
  </p>

  <h3>Projectile Fired Horizontally</h3>
  <p>
    When a projectile is fired horizontally, its initial vertical velocity is zero. 
    The horizontal motion of the projectile is independent of its vertical motion.
    The trajectory of the projectile is a parabolic path where the object falls freely under gravity in the vertical direction while moving at a constant horizontal velocity.
  </p>

  
  <h3>Projectile Fired at an Angle</h3>
  <p>
    When a projectile is fired at an angle with respect to the horizontal, its motion can be broken down into horizontal and vertical components.
    The horizontal motion is uniform and independent of the vertical motion, while the vertical motion is influenced by gravity.
    The trajectory of the projectile follows a curved path known as a projectile motion.
