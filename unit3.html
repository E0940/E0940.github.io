<h1>Unit 3: Energy</h1>
<h2>Work and Energy</h2>
<h3>Work</h3>
<p>
 Work in physics is defined as the energy transferred to or from an object via the application of force along a displacement.
</p>
<p>
 The formula for work is given by: <br>
 Work = Force x Distance x cos(θ)
</p>
<p>
 Where:
 <ul>
   <li> Work is the energy transferred to or from an object via the application of force along a displacement</li>
   <li> Force is the magnitude of the force applied</li>
   <li> Distance is the length of the displacement</li>
   <li> θ is the angle between the force and the displacement vectors</li>
 </ul>
</p>

<h3>Power</h3>
<p>
 In physics, power is defined as the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred.
 The formulas for power are given by: <br>
 Power = Work / Time <br>
 Power = Force x Distance / Time<br>
 Power = Force x Velocity
</p>

<h2>Forms of Energy</h2>
<h3>Potential Energy</h3>
<p>
 Potential energy is the energy an object possesses due to its position or state.
 The formula for potential energy is given by: <br>
 Potential Energy = Mass x Acceleration Due to Gravity x Height
<h3>Gravitational Potential Energy</h3>
<p>
 Gravitational potential energy is the energy an object possesses due to its position relative to a reference point.
 The formula for gravitational potential energy is given by: <br>
 Gravitational Potential Energy = Mass x Acceleration Due to Gravity x Height
</p>

<h3>Elastic Potential Energy</h3>
<p>
 Elastic potential energy is the energy stored in an object when it is stretched or compressed.
 The formula for elastic potential energy is given by: <br>
 Force on a spring = Spring Constant x Change in Spring Length
</p>

<h3>Potential Energy of a Spring</h3>
<p>
 The potential energy stored in a spring when it is compressed or stretched is known as the potential energy of a spring.
 The formula for potential energy of a spring is given by: <br>
Potential Energy of a Spring = 0.5 x Spring Constant x (Change in Length)<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<h3>Kinetic Energy</h3>
</p>
<p>
 Kinetic energy is the energy an object possesses due to its motion.
 The formula for kinetic energy is given by: <br>
Kinetic Energy = 0.5 x Mass x Velocity<sup>2</sup>
</p>

<h2>Work-Energy Relationship</h2>
<p>
 The work-energy relationship describes how work done on an object changes its energy.
 For conservative forces, the work done by the force is stored as potential energy and can be fully recovered.
 For non-conservative forces, the work done by the force is not stored as potential energy and is usually dissipated as heat or sound.
</p>

<h3>Conservation of Energy</h3>
<p>
 In a closed system where only conservative forces act, the total mechanical energy (potential energy + kinetic energy) of the system remains constant.
</p>
<h2>Ideal Mechanical Systems</h2>
<p>
 Ideal mechanical systems are those that do not account for any energy losses. In an ideal system, all energy input is converted into useful work without any losses, such as friction or heat dissipation.
</p>

<h3>Characteristics of Ideal Systems:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No energy losses during energy conversions</li>
  <li>Efficiency of 100%</li>
  <li>Work input equals useful work output</li>
</ul>

<h2>Non Ideal Mechanical Systems</h2>
<p>
 Non ideal mechanical systems are those that experience energy losses due to factors such as friction, air resistance, heat dissipation, and other inefficiencies. These losses result in a lower efficiency compared to ideal systems.
</p>

<h3>Characteristics of Non Ideal Systems:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Energy losses during energy conversions</li>
  <li>Efficiency less than 100%</li>
  <li>Some work input is dissipated as heat or sound</li>
</ul>
<p>The total energy of a nonideal system is given by this formula: <br>
Total Energy = Potential Energy + Kinetic Energy + Internal Energy
  </p>
